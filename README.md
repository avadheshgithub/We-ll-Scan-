## Overview 📋

**We-ll-Scan-** is a healthcare project designed to assist people in rural areas and other regions with limited access to doctors. By analyzing previous medical test reports, our platform can predict whether you have specific diseases such as heart disease, kidney disease, or diabetes, and identify the stage of the disease. Our website also provides recommendations for further tests and medications based on the diagnosis and disease stage. Additionally, it helps you find the best nearby hospitals for treatment.
